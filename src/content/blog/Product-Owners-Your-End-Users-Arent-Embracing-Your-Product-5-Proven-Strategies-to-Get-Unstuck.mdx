It's the classic standoff - As a Product Owner, you've been tasked with replacing an existing application and process. However the internal users don't love this idea. Yesterday - we learned 5 reasons why people are resisting adoption of your product: https://mlevison.com/blog/product-owners-five-reasons-your-end-users-aren-t-embracing-your-product. Today we will learn how to influence change.

Background: 
As the Product Owner for a new internal procurement app at a midsized retailer clinging to outdated processes reminiscent of the 1990s, you are tasked with replacing a chaotic system that relies on a patchwork of spreadsheets and a sluggish reporting mechanism. This leads to ad hoc purchasing decisions that bypass official protocols. Despite the new application’s potential to streamline operations, your biggest challenge lies with the administrative staff. They depend on individual Excel spreadsheet templates they consider effective. Instead of welcoming the new system, they perceive it as an imposition by management, creating friction that complicates their lives.

Dealing with the Influence Problems:
**Loss of Autonomy**: 
Involve them in the change process; Invite them to your Sprint Review meetings, and invite them to use the application during the Review. (Massive hint - Show and Play, not Show and Tell). This approach reduces the feeling of imposition and helps them feel like they’re part of the change.

**Status Quo Bias** and **Endowment Effect**: 
Work with them to understand why they value their spreadsheets so much. Showcase the hidden costs of their current approach such as mistakes, and the time spent clarifying details. In the bigger picture, demonstrate the organizational cost of those errors on an annual basis. 

**Uncertainty**: 
When faced with risk, our natural reaction is to hit the pause button. Alleviate this by inviting administrative staff to start with a trial period, using the app for a few purchases. Assure them that if it doesn’t work, they can revert to their beloved spreadsheets. Additionally, offer more hand-holding for early users.

**Distance**:
(Bonus we didn't cover this one yesterday) When communicating with someone whose views are too far removed from yours, you might inadvertently reinforce their existing beliefs. Research shows that when vaccine-hesitant parents were shown evidence contradicting fraudulent claims, it decreased their intention to vaccinate. In your workplace, if someone's stance is too far from yours, they may dig in their heels instead of embracing your proposal. Start with individuals who occupy the middle ground. Once they become users of your application, they can help bring the more resistant colleagues on board. 

**Corroborating Evidence**: 
Hearing the same pitch a second time, even with more context and information turns people off. Our brains don't perceive it as new information, we think same person, same old song. New information, has to be seen as coming from elsewhere. An industry trade publication? Yes. A story from another company in our industry? Yes. (As long as we're not the one to relay it). Even better, a co-worker who has experience using the application we're building.

Remember, All of this will take time. Influence is built on building authentic relationships with those you want to help. You can't influence someone who doesn't trust you. (Well you can try, but it's dangerous, manipulative and just downright gross).
