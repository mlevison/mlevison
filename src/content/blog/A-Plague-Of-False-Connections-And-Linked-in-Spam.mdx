We interrupt our regularly scheduled postings on influence to address LinkedIn spam. I've been more than a little bit grossed out.

LinkedIn has become a challenging place to spend time over the past few months. Nearly every contact request turns into an attempt to sell me something:

- Do I want to buy a mailing list? _Absolutely not_
- Do I want a stranger to teach me how to use social media? _Definitely not_
- Do I want SEO help with my website? _Still no_

Recently, these attempts have become more subtle. Someone reaches out to connect, praises my writing, sends several friendly messages, and then asks to cross-promote their workshops to my clients and mine to theirs.

Just no. I do collaborate with others, but not to cross-promote. I collaborate when I believe I can build something new and valuable with partners (hat tip to Bernie and Anil), not for the sake of making a few extra dollars.

My promise, if you sign up for our newsletter or take a workshop from me:

- I don't resell your information to other people.
- I don't cross-promote other people's products to you.
- My clients are not a source of $$ to be exploited.

When I seek to make money in our business relationship, it will be clear and direct. I offer learning and charge money for it.

If you have a service to offer, please don't reach out to me via LinkedIn, email, or otherwise, asking if I want your service. Especially don't befriend me only to ask about cross-selling.
