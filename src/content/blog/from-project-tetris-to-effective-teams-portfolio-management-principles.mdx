Before we try practices, we need to understand the key principles.

Agile approaches flipped the script from staffing projects to [stable teams](https://agilepainrelief.com/glossary/stable-teams).

1Ô∏è‚É£ Bring work to Teams; don't scatter people across projects  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Create clear boundaries between stakeholders and teams  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Prioritize visualization and collaboration  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Empower teams through self-organization  
5Ô∏è‚É£ Make timely decisions, especially reversible ones  
6Ô∏è‚É£ Focus on value creation over cost reduction

Key Benefits:  
‚Ä¢ Increased team stability  
‚Ä¢ Better predictability    
‚Ä¢ Higher quality deliverables  
‚Ä¢ More engaged teams
All of which lead to more value delivered

Remember: Without stable, focused teams, there's no predictability in the system. Effective Portfolio Management isn't about control. It's about giving Teams clarity and focus and then getting out of their way.

Tomorrow, we will look at the mechanics.
