Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to grapple with real-world applications. Last week, I critiqued NotebookLLM's readiness for prime-time use (https://mlevison.com/blog/notebook-llm-the-promise-of-efficiency-or-just-a-rusty-set-of-shears). This week, after listening to [Hardfork](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyQox7MMjG8), I realized I have access to the tools and decided to explore. Particularly in relation to an upcoming [Certified Scrum Developer workshop](https://agilepainrelief.com/certified-scrum-developer-csd-training).

As part of my preparation for this workshop, I wanted to create a summary of Example Mapping. A perfect opporunity to assess NotebookLLM's strengths and weaknesses.

I found five articles on Example Mapping:
- https://cucumber.io/blog/bdd/example-mapping-introduction/
- https://insideproduct.co/example-mapping/
- https://draft.io/example/example-mapping
- https://www.lostconsultants.com/2016/05/11/user-stories-acceptance-criteria-exercise/
- https://agileforgrowth.com/blog/acceptance-criteria-checklist/

It offered to write a "brief" on the subject. I got a mess on User Stories/INVEST. Since User Stories weren't really in the articles I fed it, I can only assume I broke into its training data. I've attached a picture of it generated. (Notice a couple of sentences related to the articles).

Next up I gave it an outline of my article and asked it what I was missing. I told me I was missing things in the article (ex 25 min time limit; just write examples not Gherkin) or it focused on things of low importance (Three Amigos and specific Card Colours).

When I had a final draft article, asked it for a further critique and it won't allow me to hit submit. Result, I will never get its final feedback for this writing. 

Just for fun, I took the same writing and ran it through an LLM running on my Mac - using the model: Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407-GGUF

I asked what I was missing on the subject, it gave me as good an answer as the NotebookLLM. I asked it for a critique of my writing, it had some good points. 

I'm going to try and write a deep article on pair programming, let's see if it is more helpful with 30+ sources than it was with 5.
