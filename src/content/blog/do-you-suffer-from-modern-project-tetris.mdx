At the root of these challenges, many organizations decide to do Scrum or Kanban with their teams without changing anything else in their system. 
## Challenges
➡️ Team members spread across multiple projects 
➡️ Teams constantly switching between projects 
➡️ Traditional project staffing over stable teams 
➡️ Stakeholders demands that don't align with product vision
➡️ New feature requests flooding in without considering existing commitments

These challenges lead to:
- More unfinished work and almost nothing truly Done
- Reduced Quality
- Crushed Expectations
- Team Burnout
- Grumpy Stakeholders (who thought Agile would fix everything)

The good news is that this can be solved. The bad news, it will involve hard work. Tomorrow, we will look into Lightweight Portfolio Management. (Don't worry, I won't suggest [SAFe](https://agilepainrelief.com/glossary/safe-scaled-agile-framework)).

Tomorrow, we will look at some key principles, and the next day, we will dig into mechanics.
