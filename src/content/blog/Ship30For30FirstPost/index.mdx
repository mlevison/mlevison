## Commitment ðŸ”Ž

For the next 30 Days (not weekends or holidays - I'm a Canadian after all), I commit to publishing a short essay every day on the subjects of:

- Influence for Agile/Scrum Managers and Product Owners
- Effective Scrum

I'm exploring people in my community are interested in and want help with.
